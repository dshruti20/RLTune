in=DeepSpeed is a machine learning framework
out=DeepSpeed is a machine learning framework for automating deep learning and machine learning inference. DeepSpeed is a powerful, multi-factor machine learning framework for artificial intelligence. As with many of its competitors, DeepSpeed delivers unmatched performance throughout the machine learning process. We believe DeepSpeed was developed

in=He is working on
out=He is working on some crazy shit though... I think this is the guy.
Yeah, and he's so good I can see him making more money with the money he makes being so busy and shit.

out=Everyone is happy and I can just imagine how much less than it would have been in my day if my life hadn't been turned around so quickly.  It is worth the investment though
Yeah they have saved way more than it would have. There is even a couple million dollars

in=DeepSpeed is a machine learning framework
out=DeepSpeed is a machine learning framework that scales algorithms for the speed and scalability of distributed machines. You'll learn how and how to get to the edge (and how to keep getting to top of it) and see how the hardware stack performs on the machine at all times.

in=He is working on
out=He is working on a new music that is to hit the masses in the next year or 2. Probably gonna be a big influence for the next album, though
------------------------------------------------------------

in=He has a
out=He has a big belly. He looks nothing like a fat guy. His fat belly is what causes him to have these big stomach issues.
And he has all those crazy boobs.
